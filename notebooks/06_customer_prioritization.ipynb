    "**Original Question**:\n",
    "Say the budget is only enough to retain 20% base customers, how should this customer set be chosen?\n",
    "Strategies to compare:\n",
    "- High churn probability (classification)\n",
    "- Low P(alive) (BG-NBD)\n",
    "- High CLV * High churn risk (Survival-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "- *Before any analysis of results*: I would choose the High churn probability approach using a Classifier.\n",
    "    - Better prediction performance:\n",
    "        - Churn prediction: Although longer predictions have terrible recall, smaller prediction windows show excellent results. This can be because of the volatility of the data.\n",
    "        - CLV prediction: Results from Gamma-Gamma prediction have quite large MAE, so I rather be more certain than unnecessary prevention by assigning more weight to Gamma-Gamma's predictions.\n",
    "    - Action-oriented: Unlike BG-NBD where probability of being alive is evaluated right after the observation period, a Classifier gives us a future outlook where we can plan for. Again, businesses need time to gather resources. Sometimes, the BG-NBD model shows customer p_alive already >0.4, and they may have well already churned before we can do anything."
